Hi , I have made this project as part of Assignment for Frontend Developer Role.
All the necessary and must have points are kept in mind while creating this project.
 # Note: This project used Dummydata file to load customers data as backend was not mentiond in assignment . If team needs Backend too , Its just matter of few minutes and I can come with up that too.

 # Note : To load images I have used UNSPLASH API which allows only few free requests in one hour . So photos refreshing every 10 sec has been commented out but written in code base.

 # To start Application : 
First fork the repository ;
Enter into root folder ;
Run command in terminal : "npm i" ;
Finally run command: "npm start" ;
 You can see the results on your browser.
